This is a virtual book door to keep track of your progress while reading books.

Add a book through the main controls on the left.  You can browse active books, you can browse inactive books, or log out.

To create a new book, you'll have to type in the book title and subtitle.  Add in chapters by filling in the chapter title, chapter page range, and chapter sections fields (if applicable).  Each section requires a title and a page range.  Each new book is added to the active books section.

See your stats above the main controls on the left.  You can see things like "total points", "books read", "books added", "books completed", "pages read".  You can upload an image for your profile. 

Browse your active or inactive books on the right.  Move your chapter cards from the "haven't read" to the "read" section to earn points.  Each page read is worth 1 point.  When you've moved your last chapter, you have read a book!  You can then choose to move the book into "inactive" category.

While looking at books, you can click the book title that will focus that book.  You can only see information about that specific book.
